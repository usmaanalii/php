## PHP

This is a list of resources that I used to learn PHP for a university project. We were given the task of producing a twitter clone which incorporated the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), the product can be seen in the [tvitter][39811232] repository.

### Books
The core text for the module was [Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript, 4th Edition][a58943ff], I completed the book during the course. All of the code can be seen in the [following repository][3ca2a00a].

### Tutorials
After completing the book, I decided to complete various tutorials using PHP. This was mainly to prepare for the assignment by, completing intermediate topics that the book didn't cover. Some examples of concepts I went through include:

- MVC
- OOP PHP
- Form Handling

All of the tutorials are located in their own directories
